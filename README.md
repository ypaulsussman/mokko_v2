# mokko_v2

_A local-first, feature-tweaked rewrite of the original project_

## What is it, why'd you build it, and why'd you build it like this?

Great questions! You can get answers to all of those at -- in ascending order of detail/verbosity -- the (v1 repos)[https://github.com/ypaulsussman/mokko-web], the (lander)[https://www.suss.world/mokkogen], or the (about page)[https://www.suss.world/mokkogen].

## Cool; how do I run it locally?

Pull it down, `npm i`, and `npm run dev`!

If running in a private session on Firefox, IndexedDB _might_ generate errors if open in multiple windows; otherwise, though, I haven't encountered any browser issues.

## OK; I've added some features of my own and now want to deploy it to a static-hosting provider.

`npm run build`, grab the `dist` file, upload wherever desired.

"_Simple enough that even I feel like messing with it on Tuesday night in Minnesota_" is perhaps the most-stringent inertial threshold of them all... :)
